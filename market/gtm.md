# GTM Strategy and Partnerships

Cambi's launch strategy focuses on proving the concept with crypto-native users before expanding to mainstream adoption. We're not trying to onboard millions on day one – instead, we're building trust through transparent operations and consistent yield delivery.

1.  Phase one targets Brazilian crypto holders who already understand Bitcoin but want yield. Through partnerships with retail-facing apps like Picnic and Chainless, we'll offer Cambi vaults as yield products within their interfaces. These users don't need education about crypto risks – they need access to sustainable yields. By starting with this audience, we can refine our operations while building track record.

    Outreach to local web3 and bitcoin communities, as well as micro-influencer campaigns done in partnership with these distribution front-ends mentioned above are also planned to yield good results. The primary focus is on cmBRL with unlimited minting, but also validating other collateral types and stress testing our CCYOE and overall yield model.

    **Strategy**:

    * Launch with Pix integration for seamless onboarding
    * Partner with Picnic, Chainless for distribution
    * Influencer campaigns emphasizing inflation & net-worth protection
    * "Poupança Turbinada" (Turbocharged Savings) messaging

    **Success Metrics**:

    * $20M cmBRL TVL (this makes us larger than BRZ already)
    * 20,000 active users
    * 14%+ sustainable yields (beating Brazilian treasury)

    **Timeframe**: Months 1-6
2.  Phase two expands to mainstream Brazilian users through fintech partnerships. Conversations with Nubank, PicPay, and other neo-banks indicate strong interest in offering yield products that beat traditional savings. Our integration would be white-labeled – users might see "Bitcoin Savings Account" without knowing Cambi powers the backend. This approach leverages existing user trust while scaling distribution.

    This phase also includes the public launch of the protocol globally, with a more crypto-native campaign across CT and high-engagement KOL platforms so early adopters can bring in liquidity and feedback by leveraging our own UI.

    By catering to Global DeFi users seeking superior stablecoin yields

    **Strategy**:

    * List wcmUSD on Curve, Aave, Morpho
    * Emphasize 14-18% yields vs 5% competitors
    * Partner with yield aggregators (Fungi, Yearn, Beefy)
    * "The Stablecoin That Pays Your Rent" campaign

    **Success Metrics**:

    * Fill $50M cap within 60 days
    * Integration with 5+ major protocols
    * Maintain 14%+ yields

    **Timeframe**: Months 4-9
3.  The international expansion in phase three targets family offices and crypto funds seeking emerging market exposure. Here, our pitch is simple: access Brazilian yields without establishing local entities, dealing with currency controls, or navigating regulatory complexity. The blockchain rails provide something impossible through traditional channels – 24/7 liquidity for emerging market investments. By this point, Cambi already has enough track record (users, TVL, time in market) to negotiate with these entities with higher investment standards.

    The primary focus here is to sell cmBTC as both a liquidity management tool and a BTC treasury power-up.

    **Strategy**:

    * Direct BD to funds using CBYF/Maple
    * Submit DAO proposals for treasury management
    * White-glove onboarding with custom terms
    * Emphasize liquidity advantage over competitors
    * Case studies showing 8-10% effective yields

    **Success Metrics**:

    * $40M institutional deposits
    * 5+ institutional clients
    * Zero large liquidation events

    **Timeframe**: Months 7-12
4. Pan-LatAm Expansion across Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Chile, with focus on local currency synthetics with unified yield benefits as well as increasing cmUSD distribution in the region, both for retail and institutions.

**Strategy**:

* Replicate cmBRL success with cmMXN, cmCOP
* Leverage unified pool to offer superior yields
* Regional partnerships with local exchanges
* Become the "Nubank of DeFi" for LatAm

Our partnership strategy extends beyond distribution to core protocol functionality. Liqi & DUX provides access to tokenized receivables, Etherfuse offers government bond tokenization when available, and Pyth Network delivers reliable price feeds. Each partnership is strategic – we're not just integrating vendors but building an ecosystem where each participant benefits from protocol growth.

#### Growing cmBTC among institutions and treasuries

**The Liquidity Premium Strategy:**

* **Instant Liquidity**: Unlike CBYF's lock-ups, institutions can mint cmUSD against their cmBTC instantly for operational needs
* **Capital Efficiency**: They keep BTC exposure while accessing working capital - it's like a superior crypto credit line
* **Tax Optimization**: In many jurisdictions, borrowing against assets (minting cmUSD) isn't a taxable event, unlike selling BTC
* **Yield Stacking**: They earn BTC yield (3-5%) PLUS can deploy the cmUSD for additional yield (14%+)

**Specific Incentive Mechanisms:**

* **Liquidity Mining Program**: First $100M in institutional cmBTC deposits get bonus rewards (2-3% extra APY for 6 months)
* **Fee Waivers**: Institutions minting >$1M cmUSD from cmBTC pay zero fees for first year
* **Preferred Rates**: Institutional vaults get access to higher LTV ratios (70% vs 50% for retail)
* **White-Glove Service**: Dedicated account management, custom reporting, API access

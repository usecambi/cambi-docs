# Future

### **Financial Projections and Success Metrics**

While specific projections depend on market conditions and adoption rates, we can model realistic scenarios based on comparable protocols and market data. Our base case assumes measured growth focusing on sustainability over hype.

Year one targets $50 million total value locked, generating approximately $1.5 million in protocol revenue from performance fees. This assumes average yields of 12% with our 10% performance fee on excess returns. With operational costs around $500,000 annually (primarily team, operations and RWA analysis/management), the protocol reaches profitability quickly.

By year three, assuming successful partnerships and mainstream adoption, TVL could reach $1 billion. At this scale, protocol revenues of $30 million annually support expanded development, security initiatives, and potentially token holder distributions. More importantly, this scale enables access to institutional-grade RWAs, potentially directly including government bonds and corporate debt that further stabilize yields.

Success metrics extend beyond financial measures. User retention rates indicate product-market fit – we target 80% of users maintaining positions for their full lock period. Yield consistency matters more than maximum yields – delivering promised returns builds trust essential for mainstream adoption. Geographic distribution shows ecosystem health – while starting in Brazil, expansion to Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina validates the pan-Latin American thesis.

The ultimate success metric is simple: do we enable Bitcoin holders to earn sustainable yield while helping Latin Americans preserve wealth? Financial projections matter, but our mission of bridging these communities through innovative financial infrastructure drives every decision.

### **Vision for the Future**

Cambi represents more than a DeFi protocol – it's infrastructure for a new financial paradigm where geographic boundaries don't determine financial opportunity. Today, a Bitcoin holder in Tokyo has no easy way to access Brazilian yields, while a saver in Rio watches their wealth evaporate to inflation. We're building the bridge between these realities.

The immediate future focuses on proving the model in Brazil. With its large crypto-native population, established tokenization ecosystem, and high-yielding fixed income markets, Brazil provides the perfect testing ground. Success here validates the concept for expansion across Latin America, each country offering unique opportunities and challenges.

Medium-term vision includes full Latin American coverage with local currency synthetics for major economies. Imagine cmMXN backed by Mexican government bonds, cmCOP leveraging Colombian infrastructure investments, or cmARS providing the first stable savings vehicle for Argentinians. Each market requires local partnerships and regulatory navigation, but the core protocol remains consistent.

The long-term potential extends beyond Latin America. Emerging markets globally share similar characteristics – currency volatility, high local yields, limited dollar access. Cambi's model could serve savers in Nigeria, Indonesia, or Turkey. The protocol becomes a global platform for connecting capital seeking yield with markets offering yield, all powered by Bitcoin's neutral, borderless nature.

Africa is actually a huge market for native, local, decentralized stablecoins.

Throughout this evolution, certain principles remain inviolate. User funds stay secure through over-collateralization and careful risk management. Yields come from real economic activity, not token printing or circular lending. The user experience stays simple despite backend complexity. Most importantly, we remember our core mission: empowering individuals to preserve and grow wealth regardless of their geographic lottery.

### **Conclusion: Building real LatAm DeFi**

Cambi Protocol stands at the intersection of multiple massive trends: Bitcoin's emergence as pristine collateral, Latin America's crypto adoption surge, the tokenization of real-world assets, and DeFi's maturation into sustainable yield generation. By synthesizing these trends into a coherent product, we're creating something genuinely new.

We're not just another yield farm or algorithmic stablecoin. We're building critical infrastructure that solves real problems for real people. The Brazilian worker who watches their savings evaporate to inflation. The crypto holder who refuses to sell but recognizes opportunity cost. The family office seeking emerging market exposure without operational complexity. Each finds their solution in Cambi.

The journey ahead contains challenges. Technical complexity must be hidden behind intuitive interfaces. Regulatory frameworks must be navigated carefully. Partnerships must be cultivated patiently. Competition will emerge as the opportunity becomes obvious. But we have advantages that compound over time: first-mover position in Bitcoin-to-RWA yields, deep understanding of Latin American markets, technical innovations like our liquidation system, and most importantly, alignment with users' fundamental needs.

Volcano Bonds promised to revolutionize how developing nations interact with Bitcoin but delivered a centralized, inaccessible product. Cambi delivers on that original promise – permissionless access to Bitcoin-backed yields that anyone can use. We're not building a Bitcoin city or buying mining rigs. We're building something more powerful: a protocol that lets anyone, anywhere, put their Bitcoin to work earning real yields from one of the world's most dynamic economic regions.

Consider the problems we solve:

* The Brazilian worker watching savings evaporate to inflation now has cmBRL earning 20%+ in local currency, beating inflation even if staying only exposed to real
* The global saver seeking yield finds cmUSD paying 15% – triple any other legitimate stablecoin
* The Bitcoin holder who refuses to sell discovers cmBTC offers liquidity without liquidation
* The institutional fund seeking emerging market exposure accesses it without operational nightmares

Each user finds their solution in Cambi's simplified, powerful product suite.

The future of finance isn't in New York or London – it's being built in São Paulo, Mexico City, and Buenos Aires. Cambi is the bridge to that future.

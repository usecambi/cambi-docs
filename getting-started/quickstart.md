### **User Journeys and Market Segmentation**

Understanding our diverse user base is crucial to Cambi's success. Each user segment has different needs, risk tolerances, and technical capabilities, but our protocol serves them all through thoughtful design and clear pathways.

1. **The Brazilian Retail User:** Maria in São Paulo has R$10,000 in savings earning 0.5% at Itaú bank while inflation runs at 5%. She's heard about Bitcoin but finds it too volatile and complicated. Through a Cambi partner app integrated with Pix, she deposits her R$10,000, which automatically converts to stablecoins and mints cmBRL. She doesn't need to understand crypto, yields, or RWAs – she just sees her balance growing 20-25% annually in Brazilian Reais. The app shows her daily gains in a simple interface: "Yesterday: R$10,000 → Today: R$10,006.85". When she needs to spend, her Cambi-linked debit card works everywhere Visa is accepted, automatically converting what she needs while the rest keeps earning.
2. **The Global DeFi User:** Alex in Singapore discovers cmUSD offers 15% yields versus 5% from other stablecoins. He deposits $100,000 USDC and mints cmUSD, immediately seeing the difference. Within DeFi, he uses cmUSD as collateral on Aave to borrow more USDC, creating a recursive position earning him 25%+ net yields. Unlike complex strategies requiring active management, cmUSD's daily rebasing means his collateral automatically grows, improving his health factor over time. He integrates cmUSD into his yield farming strategies, finally finding a stablecoin that meaningfully contributes to portfolio returns rather than being "dead capital" between opportunities.
3. **The Institutional Bitcoin Holder:** A crypto fund managing $50M in Bitcoin faces a dilemma: they need USD liquidity for operations but don't want to sell BTC. Traditional solutions like CBYF lock their Bitcoin for months. With Cambi, they deposit 500 BTC as collateral and mint $10M cmUSD against it, maintaining Bitcoin exposure while accessing immediate liquidity. The fund earns 5% on their Bitcoin collateral plus 15% on the cmUSD they're using for operations. When Bitcoin appreciates, they can mint more cmUSD. When they close positions, they simply return the cmUSD and reclaim their Bitcoin. No complex negotiations, no waiting periods, no counterparty risk beyond smart contracts.
4. **The Emerging Market Saver:** Carlos in Mexico City wants dollar exposure but local banks make it expensive and complicated. He downloads a Cambi partner app, deposits MXN via SPEI, and mints cmUSD. For the first time, he has a dollar-denominated savings account earning 15% annually – triple what any Mexican bank offers on USD deposits. The psychological impact is profound: every morning, he sees his dollar balance has grown. In a country where the peso regularly devalues, he finally has a defense that doesn't require a US bank account or expensive remittance services.
